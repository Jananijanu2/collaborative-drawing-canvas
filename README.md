**REAL-TIME COLLABARATIVE DRAWING APP**



This is my small project where people can draw together on the same canvas in real time.



-->**How to Run**



**Step 1:** Download this project.

**Step 2:** Open the project folder with a terminal.

**Step 3:** Type:

&nbsp;          npm install and press enter 

&nbsp;          npm start and press enter

&nbsp;          Now you will be able to see Server running at http://localhost:3000

**Step 4:** Open your browser and paste:

&nbsp;          http://localhost:3000

**Step 5:** Now my project will be shown to you.





**-->How to Test with Many Users**



* &nbsp;Open my app in two browser tabs.
* &nbsp;Draw in one tab, and you will see the same drawing in the other tab.
* &nbsp;You will also see a red dot showing the other person’s cursor moves.
* &nbsp;Try Undo and Redo buttons to check history.





**-->Known Limitations \& Bugs**



* &nbsp;If you're cursor moving or any other user cursor moving it shows the same **red dot** for all.
* &nbsp;Undo and Redo only works for your own tab, it will not shared with other users.
* &nbsp;Nothing is saved — closing the tab clears the drawing.





**-->Bonus Features** 



* &nbsp;Mobile touch support for drawing (works on phones/tablets).
* &nbsp;Creative features like shapes (circle, rectangle) and text.





**-->Time Spent**



* &nbsp;Server setup: 3 hours
* &nbsp;Canvas drawing: 3 hours
* &nbsp;WebSocket sync: 4 hours
* &nbsp;Undo/Redo: 3 hours
* &nbsp;Debugging: 4 hours
* &nbsp;Writing docs: 1 hour



**Total**: About 18 hours
